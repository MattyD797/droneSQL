Are shared via Google Drive because of size. 

## Progress
- [X] Verify microcontrollers (e.g. RAM, Zero or Zero 2 W) of existing Raspberrys, interface with Robot Operating System (ROS).
- [X] Install SQLite database code from pi repository (easy and straightforward).
- [ ] Develop modular code (C functions) to call for writing data to database.
- [ ] Test/verify.
- [ ] Install a geopackage template (use default template or develop code to create).
- [ ] Design GIS data models for the kinds of data collected by the drone.
- [ ] Develop modular code (e.g. Python/C functions) to call for writing data to geopackage/database.
- [ ] Test/verify.
- [ ] Check for single and double precision of coordinates.
- [ ] Test each remotely from existing drone.
- [ ] Port to Teamâ€™s drone for testing.
