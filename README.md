# droneSQL
Create a database management system for a customized multi-sensor unmanned aircraft system.

## Progress
-[ ] Verify microcontrollers (e.g. RAM, Zero or Zero 2 W) of existing Raspberrys, interface with Robot Operating System (ROS).
-[ ] Install SQLite database code from pi repository (easy and straightforward).
-[ ] Develop modular code (C functions) to call for writing data to database.
-[ ] Test/verify.
-[ ] Install a geopackage template (use default template or develop code to create).
-[ ] Design GIS data models for the kinds of data collected by the drone.
-[ ] Develop modular code (e.g. Python/C functions) to call for writing data to geopackage/database.
-[ ] Test/verify.
-[ ] Check for single and double precision of coordinates.
-[ ] Test each remotely from existing drone.
-[ ] Port to Teamâ€™s drone for testing.
